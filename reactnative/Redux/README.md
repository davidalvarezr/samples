# Learn Redux with a simple example

If, like me, you don't understand anything about Redux, this project is made for you. It is just a simple counter app. The state is always displayed so that it is easier to undertand. in this app, you can :

* Increment / decrement a value
* Reset a value
* Select the step (for increment / decrement)
* Select the reset value
